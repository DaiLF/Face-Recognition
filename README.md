# Face-Recognition
Face recognition based on baidu AI platform open face comparison API interface small procedures
This project is based on baidu Ai platform, okay let's do it
You can use the project code to create your own face recognition applet. Before you start, you need to understand the structure of the project
1. you need go to the **Baidu AI open platform** and sign up for an account, because you will need **APP_ID  API_KEY and SECRET_KEY** to use the AI platform.
2. We use OpenCV to drive the camera for face image retrieval, so you need to install OpenCV and related library files
3. The directory organizationï¼š
```
                              |---FaceFile/
                              |---FaceRecognition/
                              |---Access_Token.py
                              |---AI_face.py
```
FaceFile: tore photos that have been tagged. Note that the photo should be named after the user name, for example, jack.jpg
FaceRecognition: Save the XML file for OpenCV face detection
